# Set-Type
A set is unordered collection of elements, much like a set in Mathemetics. The ordered of elements is not mentioned in the sets. it means the elments may not appear in the same order as they are entered into the set, Sets are represented using curly brackets{}.

Example:-

                                        data = {10, 20, 30, "Ethan", "John", 40}
                                        print(data)
                           Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
                           Set things can show up in an alternate request each time you use them, and can't be alluded to by record or key.
                           
A set does not accept duplicates elements. Sets are unordered so we can not access it elements using index, Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.
                                        
                                        Duplicate values will be ignored:
                                 data = {10, 20, 30, "Ethan", "John", 40, 20, 10}
                                 print(data)
